	<h3>my name is asparism</h3>
	<p>
	  i believe in cultures made of genuine people, practical abstraction, and putting others before oneself.<br>
	  i love tools that make application development more accessible, such as
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">books like 'You Dont Know JS'</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://reactjs.org">frameworks like React</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com">website builders like Squarespace</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/">visual programming like Max</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  and more. i hope that one day soon, every student graduating high school will understand and use the tools they need
	  to create their own electronic realities.
	</p>

	<p>
	  i am really passionate about learning, especially learning how to learn.
