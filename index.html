	<h3>my name is asparism</h3>
	<p>
	  i believe in cultures made of genuine people, practical abstraction, and putting others before oneself.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  i love tools that make application development more accessible, such as
	  <ul>
		<li>books like <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">'You Dont Know JS'</a></li>
		<li>frameworks like <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a></li>
		<li>website builders like <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a></li>
		<li>visual programming like <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/">Max</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  and more. i hope that one day soon, every student graduating high school will understand and use the tools they need
	  to create their own electronic realities.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	  here are some projects that i have created:
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/asparism/jigsaw" target="_blank">jigsaw</a> - a library of mvc-type functions</li>
		<li></li>
