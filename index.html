<h3>my name is asparism</h3>
<p>i believe in cultures made of genuine people, practical abstraction, and putting others before oneself.<br>
  i love tools that make application development more accessible, such as
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">books</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">frameworks</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">content management systems</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">visual programming</a></li>
  </ul>
  and more. i hope that one day soon, every student graduating high school will understand and use the tools they need
  to create their own electronic realities.
